# Only Selection Games Are Anti-Inductive

## What good is a taxonomy?

In _Man, Play and Games_ Roger Caillois suggest that forms of play can be taxonomized as:

-  **Agon** or competition, e.g., Chess, Go, and other purely "learn the rules and win" games
-   **Alea**, or chance, e.g. gambling and anything you can't control
-   **Mimicry**, e.g., role-playing and any play that copies dynamics from "real life" and is meant to engage with a representation of out-of-game dynamics
-   **Ilinx** (Greek for "whirlpool") physical and perception-altering play, such as spinning until one is dizzy, riding a roller coaster, or taking drugs.

Of course it's rare to see these forms of play in complete isolation. More commonly we can identify elements of multiple different forms in a game, e.g. Basketball has the "rush" of physical execution and raised hear rates, but involves strategy as well.

Though it's been a few years, I recall _Man, Play and Games_ as a fun read, albeit one that left me wondering: What's really the point? These categories certainly refer to something real, but they tend to blur and crumble when we want to do something non-obvious with them, e.g. make a connection between Alea and Mimicry games and their hybrids.

With this critique in mind, I would like to propose my own taxonomy. This taxonomy, like Caillois's, only describes elements of games (so most games included multiple categories in their gameplay), but the categories have been constructed in a way that makes them easy to play with because I provide a procedure for turning a game of one type into another in order to show what makes these categories distinct. The types are as follows:


- **Selection** play, where winning is determined by a series of choices. Turn-based games tend to be entirely selectional as they avoid mechanics that require clever execution, rather than a proper plan. This is a generalization of [selection games](https://pfeilstorch.substack.com/p/selection-games) wherein the game is simply to make a single choice.
- **Performance** play, where one's ability to *perform* certain actions is put to the test, e.g., darts or swimming races rely on precise execution and are mostly performance play.
- **Status** play, where what one *is* is used to determine outcomes. Getting into a club is status play, as is getting selected/rejected for joining the army.
- **Betting** play, is obviously about gambling on probabilistic events.

## Decision rules for converting between types of play

Betting play is the simplest one, since it's very clear on what principles it operates: hard to predict events are predicted, observed, and evaluated. It is also easy to see what the decision rules to convert a betting game into any other kind of game:

- **Betting->Selection**—Instead of basing the choice of bets on random events, make the choice about something difficult to perceive that must be elicited, e.g., play poker where the backs of the cards reveal an NP-hard math problem that must be solved to reveal the cards identity. It is easy to see how this might also be perceived as a skill game, but I choose NP-hard here to suggest that even skill is not enough, there is a strong lower-bound of the computational resources that are required.
- **Betting->Skill**—Similar to above, reveal full information that makes betting trivial that can only be unlocked by skill, e.g. play music whose interval encode the answer, so that those with an ear for pitch differences can win.
- **Betting->Status**—Bet about something predetermined that connects to the players, e.g., bet on who weighed more at birth.

Status is the next simplest kind of play, as it simply relies on comparisons of what's already there, e.g., who dresses more "in fashion". Realistically, though, these attributes are (i) hard to discern (ii) not objective and variously prioritized and (iii) can be manipulated in ways that some could dispute as deceptive, e.g. wearing shoes that give you a little height boost. The decision rules for converting status games are:
- **Status->Selection**—Instead of basing who wins on a property attached to the person, e.g. hair color, make it about a professed attribute, e.g. favorite color. Now people will lie in order to choose the "best" option, which often causes the notion of best to become more complicated, a classic coordination game that is completelt selectional.
- **Status->Skill**—This is a funny one, because lots of the time we end-up doing this automatically. For instance, we make "being muscular" high status, partially because it signals developing the discipline to go the gym and the bodily skills associated with one's exercise regime. However, if "being muscular" still feels like a status game, then we can instead convert the decision rule to a competition that would require a given status, e.g., being able to bench press a certain amount
- **Status->Betting**—This is the exact opposite of the previous rule, instead of comparing shoe size, compare dice rolls!

**Performance**, while by no means _easy_ is simpler than selection in terms of the dynamics it produces at the time of the performance. That said, *practice* is really a kind of selection play, and so most performance games rely on some kind of underlying selection (in terms of pratice) and status (in terms of what one is talented at before one starts practicing), and of course many games contain some amount of randomness. The rules for converting performance games are as follows:
- **Performance->Selection** Instead of attempting to perform a complex action, simply require the correct action to be chosen from a list. For instance, create version of Guitar Hero where time only proceeds forward when you press the indicated button, but the time it takes to do this is not considered in the final score.
- **Performance->Status** Indeed, many performance games are attempt to check the status of a complex object. Comparing the maximum weight two people can use for a given weight lifting exercise clearly blurs this line, but making the game "who has largest bicep circumference" converts this to a clear status game.
- **Performance->Betting** This is trivial, as all conversations into betting are, as whatever state of the game once relied on some kind of other mechanism becomes due to chance. In this case, we could convert pressing a button down at the right time with a random coin flip.

**Selection**, produces the most interesting social dynamics, as selection games tend to be _reflexive_, e.g. if I ask everyone in a room to think of a number that someone else is thinking of, most of the guesses will be under 10, as small numbers are natural schelling points due to their frequency of use. The final set of rules for game conversion:
- **Selection->Performance** If there's a game that requires you to choose a move, e.g. checkers, then give away the "correct move" but require the player to perform some action, e.g. holding their breath for 2 minutes, in order to "get" the desire action.
- **Selection->Status** Similarly, switch the "decision points" to rely on already-present properties. A shade of this is often present implicitly in games where external knowledge can be leveraged, as certain types of knowledge are more common in one or another group, e.g. Christians tend to know more Bible passages and would have an edge in recalling related facts for a puzzle.
- **Selection->Betting** Ignore the user's choice in a selection game, and simply randomize the outcomes.

## Okay, but why do these rules matter?

What have we gained? Obviously there's nothing very interesting about the alternative games we can use these rules to create, because the heart of the game is actually the dynamics of play that bring us joy. This is closer to Caillois's taxonomy, which is meant to be a taxonomy of what makes a game _pleasurable_. The above, it should now be clear, is a taxonomy of what causes changes in the game state, e.g. what causes a piece to move on the Chess board is a choice, but in Guitar Hero it is the *skill* of the paper in doing what they already know they have to that determines how the game proceeds. 

A few observations:
- Many, possibly most, games involve multiple kinds of play. In some cases an attempt is made to exclude one, e.g. Chess has no randomness built into it, but this is often difficult, e.g. Humans aren't fully calculating decision trees and their judgement has "randomness" in the form of opaque mental states that the player themselves can neither fully control or understand.
- Status games occur all the time in (and especially as prerequisite to) social interactions, e.g. you decide if somone is approachable in advance of talking to them and they hold themselves in a way that might be more or less approachable. Note that approachability is highly perspective dependent.
- Selection games are the most common kind of game we can explicitly see in social interaction, as we are always creating them into order to coordinate, enternain ourselves, protect ourselves, etc. The classic example is breaking a cookie in half and having the other party choose which half they want.

What makes for interesting, useful, and enjoyable dynamics deservers more attention, but we will leave that to future essays. Here, instead, we will focus on why selection games are special.

## Only selection games are anti-inductive

First of all, selection games are special because it is easier to create interesting ones in advance for a wide audience. With performance games, people's skill varies and is often not as clear from initial interaction, but the basic facility for understanding choices and trade-offs is the heart of socialization: "Where do you want to go for lunch?"

However, this might be merely the byproduct of humans' tendency to use selection games for millenia, and I think there's a more basic reason for that fact: only selection games, are anti-inductive.

Anti-inductivity is the property that as knowledge/strategies/observations regarding a certain game are proliferated throughout a population, the given knowledge gives less and less of an edge in a game. [Markets are anti-inductive](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h24JGbmweNpWZfBkM/markets-are-anti-inductive), because knowledge that everyone has available tends to be factored into pricing.

Selection games are, by and large, anti-inductive. The obvious case of this is a zero-sum game played on parallel identical spaces, e.g. a sudoku speed running competition. These games are anti-inductive because as soon as a better strategy is known it will be widely proliferated. Most games with shared spaces between the players like Chess and Go have similar properties, as once a given strategy is known with enough computation it can be countered, or the game can be played to avoid it.

Performance games are usually not anti-inductive because they rely more on practice, either of the game or component skills. However, the choice of how to practice or how to view the current game field is a selection game in itself, so there can certainly be anti-inductivity in that regard. There may also be mental anti-inductivity: once the four-minute mile was broken, it was replicated much more easily. It is not clear precisely why this is, but some theorize it could be a mental barrier in advance to proof-of-possibility.

Status games, again, seem anti-inductive: fashion is a clasic anti-inductive phenomenon, because it is clear that if too many people dress a certain way it ceases to be as fashionable. However, I would argue that, like Performance games, this occurs before the game even starts, and is the result of iterated Status games that are all part of a larger selection game.

I am not trying to split hairs, here. Instead, I am suggesting that much of the games we play are simply carrying out the result of a high-level selection game, while engaging in the normal human rituals that don't allow for instantaneos selection. If you come over dressed to a party, you have forced your hand in terms of certain kinds of "fashion status", and the focus shifts to selection games where you have a chance of winning, exactly because a single instance of a status game doesn't have much room for maneuvering.

With betting games, there can be no question: pure randomness is not anti-inductive at all.

**Sidenote:** What about selection games that aren't anti-inductive? There are relatively few that don't have a large dollop of anti-inductivity, because games that aren't anti-inductive usually end-up skewing towards a group with the natural talents/resources/etc. to win. In practice this means that other people stop playing if they can, in which case the game _becomes_ anti-inductive within the sphere of those who play, who don't have such deficiencies. Furthermore, non-zero sum games can always be converted to zero-sum games by comparing people's individual outcomes, which is a very common behavior for humans.

## Who cares?
 
First, this seems to indicate that anti-inductivity is a very good method for getting population-wide improvement. As soon as a benefit is realized, it quickly proliferates, and pushes for now innovation. This might be selected for in human (genetic *and* cultural *and* memetic) evolution because individuals rely on living in a healthy community to function. Not only do improvements in the group benefit individuals but also this guards against being out-competed by another group for a set of resources, e.g. land.

Second, I think we choose to play anti-inductive games in social circumstances, under the understand that we never want to "lose someone at the back of the pack". It's true that if someone can't play the right social games they may eventually be abandoned by their friends, but by and large people adjust the games they play to the friends they have, so we actively search for games that force everyone to put in effort but don't assure victory to any one party. Indeed, these games are exactly indicative of a social group, and it would be interesting to use the games people play as a way to measure social networks.

Finally, the degree of anti-inductivity tends to indicate something about a game: how *learnable it is*. If a game is highly anti-inductive, it tends to be very easy to adjust one's strategy. This is, of course, the place that humans shine, and playing high-fluidity games is something that humans have attempted to hone their skills for, as societal organization involves lots of such complex games, e.g. office politics involves all of these elements but especially selection games.

## What else?

This has been a basic sketch of types of play, and why selection play is special in regards to its anti-inductivity. However, anti-inductivity is a general word for the way knowledge proliferates so that widely-held notions do not offer a competitive edge. The better question is, what kind of dynamics does this anti-inductivity involve so that things actually move forward?
